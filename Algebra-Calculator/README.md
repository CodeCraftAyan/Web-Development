# Algebra Calculator

An intuitive algebra calculator designed to compute various algebraic expressions. This project was built from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to deliver an interactive and user-friendly experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Formula Selection**: Choose from a variety of algebraic formulas.
- **Real-Time Results**: Instantly calculate and display results.
- **Calculation History**: Keep track of previous calculations, with options to clear or reset.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Built From Scratch**: Entirely handcrafted without the use of frameworks or libraries.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating a responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and performing calculations.

## Available Formulas

1. \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\)
2. \((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\)
3. \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\)
4. \((x + a)(x + b) = x^2 + (a + b)x + ab\)
5. \((a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca\)
6. \((a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\)
7. \((a - b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3\)
8. \(a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)\)
9. \(a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2)\)
