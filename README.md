# Web Development Projects

Welcome to my **Web Development** repository!  
This repo contains a collection of my personal and practice projects built using technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, **Tailwind CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Python**, and **Flask**.

---

## What?

This repository is a growing collection of full-stack and frontend projects created as part of my learning journey and experimentation with web technologies. These projects aim to solve real-world problems or deliver fun interactive experiences.

---

## How?

Each project is built using modern web technologies including:

- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid UI styling
- **Python + Flask** for backend logic (where needed)
- **APIs** for dynamic content and integration

Projects are structured and documented to be easy to understand and deploy locally.

---

## Why?

The best way to learn and improve as a web developer is by building. This repository not only reflects my skills and progress, but also serves as a portfolio of the mini tools and apps I’ve developed to sharpen my knowledge and help others.
